Hello we are [Kimchi or DimSum](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ijYrmKjAhSs4Hv7gVM1BQ), your favorite KPOP news and analytic KPOP news channel. This is the long term project for Kimsum website. feel free to contribute!
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## First feature, Stream Kimchi or DimSum video on our Website!
Powered by YouTube Data API V3. (For development, please provide your own API key, you can set it as .env.local variable of KEYTWO)
P.s: Sorry if our Watch feature is Error 500, It's because of the API call limitation!
But, ENJOY!!!
